# Snake Game Using Python

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game features a graphical interface with dynamic snake movement, point collection, and obstacle avoidance.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Controls:** Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- **Dynamic Point Generation:** Points appear randomly on the screen for the snake to collect.
- **Collision Detection:** The game checks for collisions with walls and the snake's own body.
- **Scoring System:** Keep track of your score, and the game stores the highest score achieved.
- **Restart and Quit Options:** Press 'R' to restart the game or 'Q' to quit.

## Project Structure
- **Images:** Includes graphics for the background, walls, snake, and point.
- **highest_score.txt:** A text file storing the highest score achieved.
- **Python Code:** The main game logic implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

3. Run the Python script to start the game.

```bash
